What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialiaize a repository, this creates a new subdirectory named .git that 
contains all the necessary files to the repository - a Git repository skeleton.
We need to do this because without this we couldn't commit our repository or the 
files in it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area offers the possibility of think about what will look like our commit 
into our working directory before make it really, with this thing we can cancel our commit,
if we think that to early or something like that. It also allows to commit multiple files
together.
